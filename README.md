# Force-Plate-Data-Analysis-3
This was initially part of an assignment I had from grad school (Exercise Science) in my Biomechanics class. This is just a result of me taking a deeper dive into the analysis of the data using Python. This part of the assignment had to do with analyzing a ~5sec. recording of someone performing 3 separate Bilateral Countermovement Jumps, each recorded at a different frequency (100Hz, 500Hz, 1000Hz), on a Force Plate. I have the results of the calculations in each section commented out, as well as the calculations themselves so that I can run one at a time. You would only need to change the location where the sheet is located when creating the dataframes if you were to run these calculations on your own computer.
